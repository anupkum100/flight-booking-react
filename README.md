## `Main Points `

* Fill the form and click on Search to see the flights according to the criteria
* Click on Return and Search flight to see the list of return flights 
* The total flight amount will be changed once the user changes the number of passengers 
* Price slider will work for the filtered flights
* There is a clear filter icon which will clear the form to default state
* For visualisation. I have added passenger icons for 1-2 passenger and + for more than 1.
* The default dates are set according to the data we have just for the sake of simplicity for testing.
* Test cases are written for the services I have used. (26 tests covered)

## `Technical suggestion`
* Use npm or yarn to install the dependecy 
* If you are in office domain u might have to change the registry npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
